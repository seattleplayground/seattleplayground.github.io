<h1>Seattle Playground Ultimate</h1>

<p>Seattle Playground is a new competitive men's team in Seattle in 2022</p>

----

<p>We have three core values: growth, unity and play (in a learn-by-doing, go-to-lots-of-tournaments sense).</p>

<p>Tentative practice schedule: one weekend and one weekday practice rotating between north Seattle and south Seattle locations, plus one smaller pod workout (with teammates you live closer to).</p>

<p>Our targeted level of competitiveness is to challenge for a spot at NW regionals.</p>

----

<p>Two open tryouts are planned for the end of April, followed by a small number
of closed rounds over the next 1-2 weeks.</p>
