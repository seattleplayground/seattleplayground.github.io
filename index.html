<h1>Seattle Playground Ultimate</h1>

<p>Seattle Playground is a new competitive men's team in Seattle in 2022</p>

<hr>

<h3>vision</h3>

<p>
Extensive market analysis, polling and arcane weathervane readings all point to the same conclusion: Seattle should have another competitive men's team.  The number of skilled male matching players interested in mixed outnumber the available roster spots; at the same time, the men's team we (the team planners) want to play for doesn't exist yet.
</p>



<p>
Seattle Playground is our answer: a competitive men's team focused on creating a supportive and fun environment.  We've talked a lot about how to best diffuse or avoid many of the dynamics that can make men's division experiences feel toxic, as well as what we actively want in a team, and agreed on a set of core values.  These are: individual growth and openness; uniting around an explicit vision of our goals and how to work towards them; and a commitment to simply playing a lot and getting lots of touches. Growth, unity, play. We think through being deliberate about these values and how we pursue them we'll be able to make a team worth playing on.

<h3>details</h3>

<p>Our tentative practice schedule for the season is one weekend and one weekday practice rotating between north and south locations, plus one smaller pod workout (ideally with teammates you live closer to).</p>

<p>Our targeted level of competitiveness is to challenge for a spot at NW regionals.</p>

<p>Two open tryouts are planned for the end of April, followed by a small number
of closed rounds over the next 1-2 weeks.</p>
